    <p>This cake is truly a decadent dessert, perfect for a special occasion, like Christmas, Thanksgiving, or a birthday party. I’ll walk you through each and every step in the blog post, with lots of tips & step-by-step. This beauty is truly worth the time and effort! Let’s dive in</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Sour Cream</li>
        <li>Cake Flour</li>
        <li>Cocoa Powder</li>
        <li>Cream Cheese</li>
        <li>Heavy Whipping Cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Make the Cake Batter.</b> Whisk together the dry ingredients, then mix in the wet ingredients until just combined.</li>
        <li><b>Bake the Cake Layers.</b> Divide the batter between greased and parchment paper-lined cake pans. Bake as directed in the recipe card below. Cool in the pans on wire racks for 10 minutes before inverting layers to cool completely.</li>
        <li><b>Make the Frosting.</b> In a large mixing bowl, melt the milk chocolate. Beat that with softened butter, then beat in powdered sugar, a splash of milk, vanilla, a pinch of salt, and finally some cream cheese.</li>
        <li><b>Frost the Cake.</b> Spread a layer of frosting over the first cake layer, then add the second layer of cake. Pop in the fridge to chill for 10 minutes or so, to ensure nothing slides around while you’re working with the cake. Repeat with the second cake layer, then add the third layer upside down for a perfectly flat top. Frost the outside of the cake with the remaining frosting. Let chill in the fridge for at least 30 minutes, or up to overnight.</li>
        <li><b>Make Chocolate Truffles.</b> The base of this recipe is simple – pour simmering heavy cream over chopped semi-sweet chocolate in a heatproof bowl, then stir until completely smooth. Chill this in the fridge until it’s solid, then scoop into balls. Chill them again and then roll the truffles in cocoa powder, chopped nuts, or dip them in chocolate.</li>
        <li><b>Finish Decorating the Cake.</b> Once the frosting has set, add your chocolate drip. This is made in the same way we made the truffles – simmering heavy cream is poured over chopped chocolate.</li>
    </ol>
